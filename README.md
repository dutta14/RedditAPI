# RedditAPI
An app demonstrating the use of Reddit Listing APIs

Given a 'listing' endpoint to the reddit API (https://www.reddit.com/dev/api), the goal of this project is to display a list of reddit listings with the thumbnail and title. This list is paginated. Clicking on one of the rows will take the user to a view with the comments for that listing.
